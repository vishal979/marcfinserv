						<h2>Unsecured Loans</h2>
						<p>Unsecured loans are the loans that are approved without the need of collateral security. Instead of pledging assets to lender,one can get the loans based on their income and repayment history. The credit team underwrites the client’s case based on ability to pay with his income documents and intention to pay with his past repayment history.
							At times, these loans are called signature loans as your signature on loan agreement is all that you bring to the table. Yes there is a promise to pay but that promise is not backed up by any collateral security.
							<br>
							In current market there are personal loans which are availed by salaried employees and then there are business loans which are meant for self employed. The business loans are used for working capital or expansion in business where as the personal loan is used to meet current financial needs such as wedding, a vacation, a medical emergency and many more. An amount is paid to customer for a specific period . The loan amount is based on client’s requirement and his repayment ability.
							<br>
							The TAT for these cases are comparatively low and client can easily get funds in his bank account in five working days, also the documentation part is quite simple and loan tenure are as high as four years.
							<br>
							These loans are also known as instant loans as many a times the loans are pre-approved for selected customers and by providing minimum documents a client can get good amount with easy repayment terms.
